# Search preview

Meilisearch Cloud gives you access to a dedicated search preview interface. This is useful to test search result relevancy when you are tweaking an index's settings.

<Capsule intent="note" title="Search preview in self-hosted instances">
If you are self-hosting Meilisearch, access `http://localhost:7700` in your browser. The self-hosted search preview only allows you to perform plain searches and offers no customization options.

## Accessing and using search preview

Log into your Meilisearch Cloud account, navigate to your project, then click on "Search preview":

When debugging relevancy, you may want to activate the "Ranking score" option. This displays the overall ranking score for each result, together with the score for each individual ranking rule:

## Configuring search options

Use the menu on the left-hand side to configure sorting and filtering. These require you to edit your index's sortable and filterable attributes. You may also add facets to perform faceted searches:
